            <h2>READ Nepal's 69 Centres serve 42 of its districts.</h2>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 18px;">READ's birthplace has its roots in Nepal, where it opened 
            its first center
            when a villagers told our founder he wanted a library to be built, and that was his only wish for the
            development of his lovable village. Since that we have inaugurated many READ centres across the country,
            offering courses and training programs in livelihood skills, literacy, health, and technology. 
            With our partner communities, we have seeded sustaining enterprises that address community needs: 
            from fish farming and turmeric farming to a community radio station. Almost 4,000 women participate 
            in savings cooperatives at READ Centers in Nepal.
                <br>
                For more than half of the rural population, it takes longer than half an hour to get to the nearest
                 all-weather road, making it hard for rural Nepalis to access resources. Social norms and prejudices
                  make girls' education a low priority, and as a result 53.3% of women can't read. Schools are often
                   inaccessible and have no books for a library or resources for a computer lab. Furthermore, 
                   less than 30% of the rural population has access to electricity.<br><br>
